# Detection of Covid-19 in an individual using Deep Learning

The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019), which first appeared in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, spread rapidly around the world and became a pandemic. It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as and when required to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia).
## About the Project

We have built a Deep Learning model to predict whether a person has Covid or Not with the help of chest X-rays. Two models- Built CNN Model from scratch, and VGG16 have been used to build the classifier. The former gave an accuracy of 75%(which we are working to get better) and the latter gave an accuracy of 90%. The dataset has been taken from Kaggle .
